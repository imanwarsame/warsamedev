In the world of civil engineering consultancy, improvement is a constant pursuit. But before diving into solutions, it's crucial to figure out if the problem is worth solving. Let's break down how to ask the right questions and validate problems effectively in the AEC industry.

ðŸ™‹ **Ask the Right Questions:**

Asking questions is essential, but it's about asking the right ones. Instead of pushing your ideas, focus on understanding user needs and project dynamics.

ðŸ˜£ **My Experience:**
