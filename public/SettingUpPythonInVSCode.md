# Setting Up Visual Studio Code for Python Development with Virtual Environments

Python is a powerful programming language widely used for everything from web development to data science. To make the most of your Python projects, it's essential to have a well-organised development environment. In this blog post, we'll walk you through setting up Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for Python development, including creating and using virtual environments and installing your first library.

## 1. Installing Visual Studio Code

If you haven't already, the first step is to install Visual Studio Code.

1. Visit the [official VS Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Download the version compatible with your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Follow the installation instructions provided for your OS.

## 2. Installing Python

Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

1. Download Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. During installation, ensure that the option to "Add Python to PATH" is checked. This makes Python accessible from the command line.

To verify the installation, open a terminal or command prompt and type:

```bash
python --version
```

You should see the Python version number displayed.

## 3. Setting Up Python in Visual Studio Code

Now that you have both Python and VS Code installed, let's configure VS Code for Python development.

1. **Install the Python Extension:**

   - Open VS Code.
   - Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the left sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
   - In the search bar, type "Python" and install the extension published by Microsoft.

2. **Select Python Interpreter:**
   - Open the Command Palette with `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
   - Type "Python: Select Interpreter" and choose the Python interpreter installed on your system. If you have multiple versions, select the one you prefer to use for this project.

## 4. Creating a Virtual Environment

A virtual environment is a self-contained directory that keeps your project dependencies isolated from other projects. This is crucial for managing packages and avoiding version conflicts.

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
2. Type "Python: Create Environment" and click it, you should see a list of Python versions you have installed on your machine, select the latest one and you should be good to go!

## 5. Installing your first library

With your virtual environment set up, you're ready to install your first library: `pandas`.

1. **Installing `pandas`:**

   - Ensure your virtual environment is active.
   - Run the following command to install `pandas`:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas
   ```

   This command installs the `pandas` library, which you can now use in your Python scripts.

2. **Verify Installation:**

   - You can verify that the library is installed by running:

   ```bash
   pip show pandas
   ```

   This will display information about the `pandas` library, confirming it's installed in your virtual environment.

## 6. Creating and Running a Python Script with `pandas`

Let's create a simple Python script to test your setup with `pandas`.

1. **Create a New Python File:**

   - In your project directory, create a new file named `app.py`.

2. **Write a Simple Script Using `pandas`:**

   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   # Create a simple DataFrame
   data = {
       'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
       'Age': [25, 30, 35],
       'Occupation': ['Engineer', 'Doctor', 'Artist']
   }

   df = pd.DataFrame(data)

   # Display the DataFrame
   print(df)
   ```

3. **Run the Script:**

   With the virtual environment active, run the script using the following command in the terminal:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   Or you can use the play button in the top right of your screen. If everything is set up correctly, you should see the DataFrame printed in the terminal, showing the names, ages, and occupations.

## 7. Managing Packages and Dependencies

As you develop your project, you might want to add more libraries. To keep track of installed packages, you can create a `requirements.txt` file:

1. **Generate `requirements.txt`:**

   - Run the following command:

   ```bash
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```

   This file lists all the packages installed in your virtual environment along with their versions.

2. **Install Dependencies from `requirements.txt`:**

   - If you share your project or set it up on a new machine, you can install all dependencies with:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Well done!

Congratulations! You have just set up your coding environment using Visual Studio Code and virtual environments, nothing can stand in your way now. Happy coding! üêç
