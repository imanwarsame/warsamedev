## Mastering the Art of 'Festina Lente' in Project Management

In the dynamic world of project management, the age-old wisdom encapsulated by the Latin phrase "Festina Lente," meaning "Make haste slowly," holds profound relevance. It's about finding that delicate balance between acting swiftly and thinking deliberately, a balance that's especially difficult in the intricate domain of large-scale projects within the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operations (AECO) industry. The following are some nuggets of wisdom from the book ‘How Big Things Get Done’ by Bent Flyvberg and Dan Gardner.

When faced with decisions, taking the time to reflect on decisions ensures thoroughness, yet acting with agility maintains momentum – a fusion of careful consideration and decisive action.

Project timelines are often tight, making it imperative to "close the window" between decision-making and project delivery. By minimising delays, decisions are swiftly translated into tangible results, amplifying efficiency and productivity.

A critical aspect of project success lies in assembling the right team. Hiring a "master builder" – a skilled professional with the expertise to navigate complexities – anchors the project with leadership and ensures excellence in execution.

Building a cohesive team is paramount. By bringing together diverse talents and perspectives, projects benefit from collaborative problem-solving and innovation, amplifying the collective capacity to overcome challenges.

At the core of effective project management lies the simple question: "why?" Constantly probing the purpose and rationale behind each project aspect ensures alignment with overarching goals, anchoring every decision in strategic clarity.

In the construction realm, the concept of "building with Lego" underscores the importance of modularity and systematic construction principles. This approach enhances efficiency and scalability without compromising quality or aesthetics.

Gaining an "outside view" by considering the project within the context of similar endeavours enriches decision-making. Drawing insights from past projects empowers project managers to anticipate challenges and mitigate risks effectively.

Vigilance is key in project management. "Watching the downside" involves proactively identifying and addressing potential pitfalls throughout the project lifecycle, fostering resilience in the face of uncertainties.

Sometimes, the most strategic decision is to say no. "Saying no and walking away" from projects or opportunities that don't align with strategic objectives ensures focused investment of resources, optimising outcomes.

Cultivating strong relationships with stakeholders is foundational. "Making friends and keeping them friendly" fosters collaboration and goodwill, laying the groundwork for successful project delivery.

Ultimately, acknowledging personal accountability is paramount. Recognising that "your biggest risk is you" underscores the importance of thorough planning and preparation, mitigating biases and minimising setbacks.

By integrating these principles into project management practices, you can navigate the complexities of any project a little bit better than you did before.
