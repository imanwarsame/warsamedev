## Open Source Software in the AECO Industry: The Future of Collaborative Innovation

Open Source Software (OSS) holds the promise to fundamentally transform how we design, build, and manage our built environment. By shifting from siloed, proprietary solutions to collaborative, open-source platforms, the AECO sector can not only accelerate innovation but also attract top talent and make meaningful strides towards sustainability. Let's explore how OSS can drive these changes.

### Accumulating Knowledge Rather Than Incremental Improvements

One of the most compelling advantages of OSS is its ability to accumulate collective knowledge rather than repeated incremental improvements in isolation. In traditional software development within the AECO industry, proprietary solutions often lead to fragmented knowledge and duplicated efforts (carbon calculators cough cough). However, OSS encourages a snowball effect—every contribution, no matter how small, adds to a larger body of knowledge that everyone can access and build upon. This collaborative approach can significantly enhance the quality and efficiency of our tools and processes.

### Attracting Tech-Savvy Talent

Big tech firms like Google, Microsoft, and Meta are well-known for their robust support of OSS. This not only accelerates innovation but also attracts the best of the best to work for them on cutting-edge projects. The AECO industry can benefit similarly. By investing in OSS, companies can position themselves as industry leaders, appealing to the technologists and tinkerers who are passionate about making a real impact. These professionals are not only adept at using advanced technologies but are also driven by the ethos of collaboration and open innovation.

### Overcoming Adoption Headwinds

Despite its benefits, OSS adoption in the AECO industry faces significant challenges, particularly concerning Intellectual Property (IP) issues. Many contracts include restrictive IP clauses that grant ownership of all employee-created IP to the employer, making it difficult for individuals to contribute to OSS. To overcome this, companies need to revisit their contractual frameworks and adopt more flexible IP policies that encourage participation in OSS. This shift would not only foster innovation but also demonstrate a commitment to transparency and collaboration.

### Learning from the Tech Industry

The tech industry offers several excellent cases of successful OSS projects. Take JSON, for example—a lightweight format for data interchange that has become a global standard for information transfer on the web. If the AECO industry could open-source foundational standards like the Eurocodes, we would enable any engineer to use and build upon these standards effortlessly. Imagine the possibilities if we had an open-source finite element modelling software where engineers could develop custom modules for specific use cases, such as masonry or high-speed rail. This would reduce reliance on a few entrenched software firms, giving them a kick to improve faster and reduce prices, and democratise access to powerful tools.

### Ownership and Community Engagement

For OSS to gain traction, it's crucial to give users a sense of ownership. When people feel they have a stake in the tools they use, they are more likely to adopt and share them with others. This community-driven approach not only accelerates the improvement of the software but also fosters a culture of mutual support and continuous learning.

### Becoming an Industry Leader

By embracing OSS, AECO firms can position themselves as pioneers in their field, enhancing their brand and attracting the brightest minds. This leadership not only boosts the company’s reputation but also drives forward the entire industry, setting new standards for innovation and collaboration.

### Fighting Climate Change Together

One of the most pressing challenges of our time is climate change. In the AECO industry, addressing this issue often involves developing numerous proprietary carbon accounting tools, each requiring significant resources. However, if we channel our efforts into a single, robust OSS carbon accounting tool, we can create a superior product that saves time and money while effectively reducing carbon in our designs. The ultimate goal isn't merely to create a tool; it’s to make our built environment more sustainable by reducing our impact, that’s what we should focus on.

Open Source Software presents a tremendous opportunity for the AECO industry. By fostering a culture of collaboration, attracting top talent, and focusing our collective efforts on common goals, we can accelerate innovation, enhance sustainability, and lead the way towards a more open and innovative future.
